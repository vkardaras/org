** Find file

#+begin_src sh
C-x C-f
#+end_src

** Major Mode Detection

File-local variables

- Header or footer to load a mode and variables

Program loader directives

- Shebangs (e.g. =#!/bin/bash=)

Magic mode detection

- Uses the variable =magic-mode-alist= for pattern matching

Automatic mode detection

- How most modes are applied
- Uses filename extensions, names, and file paths

** Writing to files

#+begin_src sh
# save current buffer
C-x C-s

# write to a new file
C-x C-w

# save all buffers
C-x s
#+end_src

** Basic navigation

#+begin_src sh
# Forward by character
C-f

# Backward by character
C-b

# Forward by word
M-f

# Backward by word
M-b

# Move to beginning of line
C-a

# Move to end of line
C-e

# Moves to the first non-whitespace character
M-m

# previous line
C-p

# Next line
C-n

# Forward by S-expression
C-M-f

# Backward by S-expression
C-M-b

# Scroll down a screen
C-v

# Scroll up a screen
M-v

# Move to the beginning of the buffer
M-<

# Move to the end of the buffer
M->
#+end_src

S-expressions cover commands that operate on balanced expressions.
e.g. Brackets are considered balanced expressions in most major modes.

** Buffer Switching, Killing, and Undoing

#+begin_src sh
# Switch to another buffer
C-x b

# List all buffers
C-x C-b

# Kill the current buffer
C-x k
#+end_src

*** Return to Normal

=Esc Esc Esc=

- Useful if you are stuck.
- Deletes all Windows (hides them).
- Prompts are exited.
- Pre-fix keys are cancelled.

*** Undoing

#+begin_src sh
C-/
C-_
C-x u
#+end_src

** Window Management

#+begin_src sh
# Split window horizontally
C-x 2

# Split window vertically
C-x 3

# Delete the active window
C-x 0

# Delete all the other windows
C-x 1

# Switch between windows
C-x o
#+end_src

*** The "Other" Window

The window immediately after the current window one if you run =C-x o=

#+begin_src sh
# find files in the other window
C-x 4 C-f

# display a buffer in the other window
C-x 4 C-o

# switch buffer in other window and make it current
C-x 4 b

# kill the current window
C-x 4 0
#+end_src

** Selecting Text

*** Setting the Mark

#+begin_src sh
# set the mark and activate or deactivate the region
C-SPC

# interchange the mark and point
C-x C-x

# similar to selecting in other windows
S + arrow keys

# set the point and mark around the text you move across
Mouse-1 + <drag>

# set the mark to where the point is and then move point to where you click
Mouse-3
#+end_src

*** The Mark Ring

Overview

- Similar to the undo ring
- Each buffer has its own mark ring
- Configure the number of entries to keep in the mark ring
- =C-u C-SPC= jumps to the mark

Global Mark Ring

- Records a sequence of visited buffers and, for each buffer, where you
  placed a mark

*** Marking Textual Objects

Words, Buffers, Pages, and Paragraphs

#+begin_src sh
# set the mark after end of the next word
M-@

# mark the next paragraph
M-h

# mark the entire buffer
C-x h

# mark the current page
C-x C-p
#+end_src

** Searching in Emacs

*** Incremental search

#+begin_src sh
# Forward incremental search
C-s

# Backward incremental search
C-r

# Regex forward incremental search
C-M-s

# Regex backward incremental search
C-M-r

# Quit the search
C-g

# Incremental word search
M-s w

# Next item in search history
M-n

# Previous item in search history
M-p
#+end_src

*** Non-incremental search

#+begin_src sh
# Forward non-incremental search
C-s <RETURN>

# Backward non-incremental search
C-r <RETURN>

# Regex forward non-incremental search
C-M-s <RETURN>

# Regex backward non-incremental search
C-M-r <RETURN>

# Quit the search
C-g

# Non-incremental word search
M-s w <RETURN>
#+end_src

*** Emacs Occur

- Uses regex for searching
- Provides a list of lines with matches
- Can activate on current incremental search string

#+begin_src sh
# Occur mode
M-x o

# Start occur mode inside incremental search
M-x o

# Next occurrence
M-n

# Previous occurrence
M-p

# Quit occur mode
q

# Edit mode
e

# Exit and apply changes
C-c C-c
#+end_src

*** Emacs Grep

- Use to search unopened files
- Provides a list of files and lines with matches
- Can open files into buffers for editing

#+begin_src sh
# Prompt for grep arguments
M-x grep

# Prompt for arguments for grep and find
M-x grep-find

# User-friendly and interactive local grep
M-x lgrep

# User-friendly and interactive recursive grep
M-x rgrep

# Like rgrep for gzip files
M-x rzgrep
#+end_src
