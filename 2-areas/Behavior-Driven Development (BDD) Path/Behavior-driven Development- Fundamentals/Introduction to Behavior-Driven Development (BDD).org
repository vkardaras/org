* Introduction to Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)

** What is BDD?

*** Definition of BDD

- A software development process
- Evolved from Test Driven Development
- Focuses on the behavior of an application

*** Why BDD?

- Bridges the communication gap between tech and non-tech roles
- Focuses on user's perspective
- Drives development with clear examples

*** BDD vs.Â TDD

- Test Driven Development (TDD): Write tests before code
- Behavior Driven Development (BDD): Write specifications before tests
- BDD provides context - TDD provides structure

*** Main Components of BDD

- Collaboration
- Requirements through real-world examples
- leveraging Automation

** What are the benefits of using BDD?

*** Improved Communication

- Bridging the tech and non-tech gap
- Clearer, more precise discussions
- A shared understanding across roles

*Enhanced Collaboration*

- Involves all stakeholders early on
- Collective ownership ensures user-centric solutions

*User-centric Development*

- Focus on user outcomes, not just features
- Ensure the product fits the market need
- Aligns team with user expectations

*Reduced Ambiguity*

Clear specifications minimize misinterpretation and reduce errors and
rework.

*** Faster Feedback

- It enables quicker feedback loops
- Clearer scenarios and automation speeds up validation
- Teams detect issues earlier
- Encourages agile, iterative development

*** Enhanced Customer Satisfaction

- Ensures software meets user needs
- Minimizes production bugs
- Enhances end-user trust

*** Continuous improvement

- A mindset encouraging improvement
- Facilitates iterative development
- Encourages regular feedback
- Teams constantly refine and improve
