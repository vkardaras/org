Build software applications that are scalable, resilient and easy to
manage

The 12-Factor App is a methodology for building software-as-a-service
applications that are scalable, resilient, and easy to manage. It was
created by Heroku and is widely adopted in the cloud-native community.

It provides us with a set of best practices for building applications
that meet these requirements.

** 12 factor principles

- Codebase
- Dependencies
- Config
- Backing Services
- Build, release, run
- Processes
- Port Binding
- Concurrency
- Disposability
- Dev/prod parity
- Logs
- Admin Processes

*** Codebase

Multiple apps sharing the same code is a violation of twelve-factor
