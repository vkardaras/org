## What to write about

- All about you
- Career and work
- Interpersonal skills
- Technology itself
- Trends and predictions
- Reviews and write-ups

## Hints and tips

- When you have an idea, create a draft post with just the title (or a dot point or two)
- Notice the conversations around you
    - What is the main question behind it all?
    - What are the little questions or points of controversy?
- Keep it simple and if in doubt, break it down into a smaller topic

## Structure

- Always write a structure before you write your first full sentence!
- Two types of writers: “can write forever” vs “struggle to write”
- Structure keeps you on track: nobody enjoys rambling
- Structure gives you something to lean on when you get stuck

**Example**

- Intro: Why deliver compliments? (Zach story)
- Why don’t people do this? (doom/gloom)
- When? (relevance/professionalism)
- How? (open true impression, experience, close)
- Conclusion: Homework/tasks

## Prioritize Active voice over Passive voice

### “We” and “Us”

Avoid “you” if at all possible

### Mostly relevant for tutorials

- “Next, you want to enter your variables within the scope of your function” vs
- Next, we want to enter our variables within the scope of our function”

### Effects

- Familiarity
- Togetherness
- Being on the same level

### External tools and add-ons

- Grammarly: Catch common grammatical mistakes
- Thesaurus: Expand your vocabulary
- Linguee/Twitter: For non-native speakers to see language in context
- Google Slides: For making preview images
