#+title: Linux Core Concepts

* Working with hardware

** Viewing Kernel and Device Events

#+begin_src shell

# display messages from the kernel's ring buffer
dmesg
# display messages from specific devices
dmesg | grep -i usb

# query and monitor device events related to uDev
udevadm info --query=path --name=/dev/sda5
# monitor kernel uEvents in real time
udevadm monitor

#+end_src

** Listing PCI Devices

PCI stands for Peripheral Component Interconnect, representing devices directly attached to the motherboard, such as Ethernet cards, RAID controllers, video cards, and wireless adapters.

#+begin_src shell

# lists all pci devices configured in your system
lspci

#+end_src

** Viewing Block Devices

#+begin_src shell

# displays the physical disk (e.g., sda) along with its partitions
lsblk

#+end_src

** Displaying CPU Information

#+begin_src shell

# insights into the CPU architecture, such as the number of cores, threads per core, cache sizes, and more.
lscpu

#+end_src

** Displaying Memory Information

#+begin_src shell

# retrieve memory configuration details
lsmem
# view a brief overview of the system's memory
lsmem --summary

# shows memory usage statistics, including total, used, and free memory
free -m

#+end_src

- =m= for megabytes
- =k= for kilobytes
- =g= for gigabytes

** Extracting Detailed Hardware Information

#+begin_src shell
sudo lshw
#+end_src

* Runlevels

#+begin_src shell

# check the default target
systemctl get-default

# change the default target
systemctl set-default multi-user.target

#+end_src

- Runlevel 5 corresponds to the graphical target (graphical)
- Runlevel 3 corresponds to the multi-user target (terminal)
