* DNS

** Map an ip to an alias
To map an ip to an alias add it to the =/etc/hosts= file
#+begin_src shell

# add an entry to the =/etc/hosts= file
192.168.1.11    db
#+end_src

** View the ip addres of your dns server
#+begin_src shell
cat /etc/resolve.conf
#+end_src

** Show used ports with processes

#+begin_src sh
sudo lsof -i -P -n | grep LISTEN
#+end_src

* DNS Record Types and Diagnostic Tools

** Types of records
- A records: Map hostnames to IPv4 addresses.
- AAAA records: Map hostnames to IPv6 addresses.
- CNAME records: Create an alias that maps one hostname to another. This is useful when a service is accessible by multiple names.

** Troubleshoot DNS resolution

#+begin_src shell

# query directly your DNS server
nslookup www.google.com

# provide detailed output of the DNS records
dig www.google.com

#+end_src

* Networking basics

#+begin_src shell

# check the ip of the device
ip a

# check the default gateway
ip r

# check the connection of the app devapp01-web from the port 80
telnet devapp01-web 80

# test the connectivity with another device
ping 192.168.1.11

# view current routing configuration
route

#+end_src

* Troubleshooting

#+begin_src shell

# verivy local network interface
ip link

# confirm DNS resolution of hostname
nslookup caleston-repo-01

# test remote connectivity
ping caleston-repo-01

# trace the network route
traceroute

# troubleshoot the repository server
# check HTTP process
netstat -an | grep 80 | grep -i LISTEN

# bring up an interface that is down
ip link set dev enp1s0f1 up

#+end_src
