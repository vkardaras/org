* maven dependency management

** Specify additional repository

- Move to =settings.xml= in =maven/conf/= directory
- Add the following in profiles tag

#+begin_src xml
<profiles>
    <profile>
        <id>spring_remote</id>
        <repositories>
            <repository>
                <id>spring_repository</id>
                <url>http://repo.spring.io/release/</url>
            </repository>
        </repositories>
    </profile>

</profiles>
#+end_src

*** After the =profiles= tag activate the repository

#+begin_src xml
<activeProfiles>
    <activeProfile>spring_remote</activeProfile>
</activeProfiles>
#+end_src

** Dependency scope

- =compile=. Default scope is =compile=. Dependencies with this scope
  are available during the =build=, =test= and =run= faces of a project
- =test=. The =test= scope is executed only during the test face of a
  project
- =provided=. Dependencies with this scope are provided from the jdk or
  the container of the environment. They are executed during the =build=
  and =test= faces of a project
- =runtime=. Dependencies with this scope are executed during =test= and
  =run= faces of a project

** Conflict resolution

*** Exclude a transitive dependency from a dependency

#+begin_src xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.test.maven</groupId>
    <artifactId>maven-conflict-example</artifactId>
    <version>1.0</version>
    <exclutions>
        <exclution>
            <groupId>org.apache.commons</groupId>
            <artifactId>commons-lang3</artifactId>
        </exclution>
    </exclutions>
</dependency>
#+end_src
