* Best practices for optimizing docker images

** Content-creating Dockerfile instructions

- COPY Instruction. Used to copy content from the build context into the
  image
- ADD Instruction. Like COPY instruction but can retrieve remote content
- RUN Instruction. Executes commands to generate additional image
  content

** Sequencing Dockerfile instructions

*** Before

#+begin_src shell
<snip>

WORKDIR /app

COPY . .

RUN yarn install

<snip>
#+end_src

*** After

#+begin_src shell
<snip>

WORKDIR /app

COPY package.json yarn.lock ./

RUN yarn install

COPY spec src ./

<snip>
#+end_src
