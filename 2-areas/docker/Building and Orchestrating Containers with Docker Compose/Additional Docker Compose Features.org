** Scale containers

Do NOT define a host port if you are going to scale a service or a
container name.

You can also define a deploy property for scaling.

#+begin_src yaml
services:
  api:
    ...
    deploy:
      replicas: 2
      restart_policy: 
        condition: on-failure
        delay: 5s
        max_attempts: 3
        window: 120s
#+end_src
