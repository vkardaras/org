They provide an executable form of documentation

*** Failures vs.Â Errors
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: failures-vs.-errors
:END:
Failure

- Tried to check behavior
- An assertion failed
- The code is probably broken

Error

- At any point in the test
- A non-assert exception was thrown
- The test is probably broken
